# yolov8
Ultralytics YOLOv8 is the latest version of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection and image segmentation model developed by Ultralytics. The YOLOv8 model is designed to be fast, accurate, and easy to use, making it an excellent choice for a wide range of object detection and image segmentation tasks. 
Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different learning rates, batch sizes, and optimizer settings to optimize model performance.
Data Augmentation: Apply augmentation techniques (e.g., random cropping, rotation) to increase dataset variability and improve generalization.
Advanced Configurations: Explore YOLOv5 documentation for advanced features like transfer learning, model ensembling, or custom architecture modifications.
YOLOv8 is the latest installment in the highly influential family of models that use the YOLO (You Only Look Once) architecture. YOLOv8 was developed by Ultralytics, a team known for its work on YOLOv3 and YOLOv5.

Following the trend set byâ€Š YOLOv6 and YOLOv7, we have at our disposal object detection, but also instance segmentation, and image classification. The model itself is created in PyTorch and runs on both the CPU and GPU. As with YOLOv5, we also have a number of various exports such as TF.js or CoreML.
